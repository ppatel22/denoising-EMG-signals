# Denoising EMG signals

## Introduction
The future of brain-computer interfaces rests on our ability to decode neural signals. Here I attempt to ensemble ML techniques to extract useful information from sEMG signals to improve downstream task performance.

## Usage
First, read the [blog post] (2023-12-12-denoising-EMG-signals.md) to understand the motivation, science, and results of this project. The code used for preparing the data is included in ```data_processing.py```. The code for the denoising autoencoder model is provided in ```model.ipynb```.
